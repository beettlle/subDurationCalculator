# Sub-Exposure Calculator v6.1

A fully automated, guided, and self-configuring optimal sub-exposure calculator for astrophotography. This intelligent command-line Python script automates finding the optimal sub-exposure time for your imaging setup using the Intelligent Scout method with optional high-precision refinement.

## Key Features

### Automated Optimal Target Finding

The script can now automatically find a suitable observation target near the zenith that is free of bright stars. The algorithm prioritizes targets east of zenith to maximize imaging time, as eastern targets stay above the horizon longer. It also avoids targets that would cause meridian flips during the experiment, preventing costly interruptions. This leads to higher-quality data by preventing bright stars from saturating the sensor and skewing the sky background measurements. This feature requires an internet connection and the astroquery library.

### Zenith Tracking

The system automatically tracks the zenith position as time passes and adjusts the telescope position to maintain optimal target selection. This prevents the telescope from drifting away from the zenith due to Earth's rotation during long experiments.

### Auto-Discovery

Automatically detects connected INDI devices (camera, mount, filter wheel, guide camera)

### Intelligent Scout Method

Uses a short test exposure to predict optimal times and generate focused test ranges

### High-Precision Refinement

Optional bracketing search refinement for maximum image quality

### Guided Calibration

Interactively guides you through creating missing Master Dark frames

### Smart Guiding

Prefers PHD2 or EKOS if running, falls back to built-in guiding

### Automatic Guiding

Starts guiding after slewing to optimal target for accurate long exposures

### Advanced Filter-Aware Focusing

Intelligently manages focus positions for each filter while minimizing unnecessary autofocus operations. Integrates with EKOS when available and provides robust fallback using internal HFD (Half Flux Diameter) autofocus.

### Efficient Experiment

Executes the core experiment in an optimized order to minimize mechanical operations

### Sensible Defaults

Uses logical defaults for common parameters

### Intelligent Analysis

Uses sigma-clipped statistics for robust sky background measurement

### Configurable Analysis

YAML-based configuration for fine-tuning analysis parameters

### Multi-Filter Support

Calculates optimal exposure times for each filter in your filter wheel

### Image Quality Analysis

Measures star FWHM and eccentricity to balance SNR with image quality

### Dynamic Seeing Adjustment

Automatically adjusts the number of test frames based on real-time seeing conditions measured from scout images. The script measures the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of stars in the scout image and dynamically adjusts the number of frames per exposure time to ensure optimal statistical accuracy:

- **Excellent Seeing (FWHM < 2.0 pixels)**: 3 frames - Fewer frames needed due to stable conditions
- **Good Seeing (FWHM 2.0-3.0 pixels)**: 5 frames - Standard number of frames for typical conditions  
- **Average Seeing (FWHM 3.0-4.0 pixels)**: 7 frames - More frames for statistical robustness
- **Poor Seeing (FWHM â‰¥ 4.0 pixels)**: 10 frames - Maximum frames for challenging conditions

This feature ensures that the experiment adapts to current atmospheric conditions, providing more reliable results in variable seeing while optimizing experiment duration in excellent conditions.

## How It Works

### Phase 0: Device Discovery and Setup
1. Connects to your INDI server
2. Automatically discovers connected devices (camera, mount, filter wheel, guide camera, focuser)
3. Prompts for selection if multiple devices of the same type are found
4. Gets filter names from the filter wheel
5. Loads telescope location from configuration for optimal target finding

### Phase 1: Dark Frame Library Creation
1. Creates a comprehensive dark frame library (10s to 1800s)
2. Enables unattended operation throughout the experiment
3. Automatically selects and scales dark frames as needed

### Phase 2: Intelligent Scout Experiment
For each filter:
1. **Phase A: Intelligent Scout & Prediction**
   - Takes scout exposure to measure sky brightness
   - Calculates sky flux rate (ADU/sec)
   - Predicts optimal exposure time based on camera properties
   
2. **Phase B: Dynamic Test Range Generation**
   - Creates focused test range around predicted optimal time
   - Ensures reasonable minimum and maximum exposure times
   
3. **Phase C: Dynamic Seeing Adjustment**
   - Measures star FWHM from scout image to assess seeing conditions
   - Automatically adjusts frames_per_light based on seeing quality
   - Ensures optimal statistical accuracy for current conditions
   
4. **Phase D: Automatic Dark Frame Selection**
   - Selects appropriate dark frames from library
   - Scales dark frames if needed for different exposure times
   
5. **Phase E: Focused Experiment Execution**
   - Finds and slews to optimal target near zenith (free of bright stars)
   - Monitors zenith drift and adjusts position as needed during experiment
   - Performs filter-aware focusing (simple re-focus or full autofocus)
   - Captures multiple frames at each test exposure time
   - Analyzes sky background and image quality (FWHM, eccentricity)
   - Calculates optimal exposure balancing SNR with image quality

### Phase 4: Optional Refinement Phase
If enabled:
1. **High-Precision Bracketing Search**
   - Tests granular exposure times around initial optimal time
   - Measures image quality metrics for each exposure
   - Finds true minimum FWHM and optimal quality threshold
   
2. **Quality-Based Optimization**
   - Balances signal-to-noise ratio with image quality
   - Selects longest exposure that maintains quality standards

### Phase 5: Results
1. Displays a formatted table with optimal exposure times for each filter
2. Shows camera properties, target ADU values, and quality metrics
3. Provides detailed analysis of both scout and refinement phases

## Technical Details

### Optimal Target Finding Algorithm
The calculator uses an intelligent approach to find optimal observation targets:

1. **Zenith Calculation**: Calculates current zenith coordinates based on telescope location and time
2. **Bright Star Query**: Queries Gaia database for stars brighter than G=9.0 within 5Â° of zenith
3. **Grid Search**: Searches a 10x10 grid around zenith for the darkest patch
4. **Eastern Preference Analysis**: Prioritizes targets east of zenith for maximum imaging time
5. **Meridian Flip Risk Assessment**: Calculates risk of meridian flips during experiment duration
6. **Combined Scoring**: Balances separation quality, eastern preference, and meridian flip avoidance using configurable weights
7. **Optimal Slew**: Commands mount to slew to the optimal dark patch coordinates

### Zenith Tracking Algorithm
The system continuously monitors and adjusts the telescope position to maintain optimal target selection:

1. **Drift Monitoring**: Checks for zenith drift every configurable interval (default: 30 minutes)
2. **Threshold Detection**: Detects when drift exceeds configurable threshold (default: 2Â°)
3. **Position Update**: Recalculates zenith coordinates and optimal target position
4. **Smart Recalculation**: Only recalculates optimal target if zenith has moved significantly (>1Â°)
5. **Automatic Slew**: Commands mount to slew to updated optimal position

### Intelligent Scout Algorithm
The calculator uses an advanced approach to determine optimal exposure time:

1. **Scout Phase**: Takes a short test exposure to measure sky brightness and flux rate
2. **Seeing Assessment**: Measures star FWHM from the scout image to assess seeing conditions
3. **Dynamic Frame Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts frames_per_light based on seeing quality
4. **Prediction**: `Predicted Time = Target ADU / Sky Flux Rate`
5. **Dynamic Range**: Generates focused test range around prediction (0.6x to 1.5x predicted time)
6. **Quality Analysis**: Measures star FWHM and eccentricity for image quality assessment
7. **Dual Optimization**: Balances noise requirements with image quality constraints

### Eastern Preference Logic
The system prioritizes targets east of zenith to maximize imaging time:

- **Earth's Rotation**: As Earth rotates, targets east of zenith stay above horizon longer
- **Imaging Time**: Eastern targets provide more time for imaging before setting
- **Configurable Balance**: Users can adjust the trade-off between eastern preference and dark patch quality
- **Smart Fallback**: If no suitable eastern target exists, falls back to western targets

### Meridian Flip Avoidance Logic
The system avoids targets that would cause meridian flips during experiments:

- **Meridian Flips**: Costly operations that can take 5-15 minutes and require recalibration
- **Risk Calculation**: Analyzes target's hour angle throughout experiment duration
- **Safety Buffer**: Uses 2-hour buffer from meridian for safe operation
- **Duration Estimation**: Calculates expected experiment duration based on exposure times and filters
- **Risk Reporting**: Provides clear warnings when meridian flip risk is detected

### Advanced Focusing System
The calculator includes an intelligent, filter-aware focusing system:

1. **EKOS Integration**: Leverages EKOS focusing capabilities when available
2. **Filter-Specific Cache**: Maintains optimal focus positions for each filter
3. **Temperature Monitoring**: Only refocuses when temperature changes significantly
4. **HFD Autofocus**: Uses Half Flux Diameter measurement for precise focus
5. **Efficient Operations**: Minimizes unnecessary autofocus operations

### Smart Guiding Integration
The system intelligently integrates with external guiding software:

1. **PHD2 Detection**: Automatically detects and uses PHD2 if running
2. **EKOS Detection**: Detects and uses EKOS guiding if available
3. **Built-in Fallback**: Provides robust built-in guiding when external software not available
4. **Priority System**: PHD2 > EKOS > Built-in guiding
5. **Seamless Operation**: No manual configuration required

### Target ADU Calculation
```
Target ADU = (target_noise_ratio Ã— read_noise)Â² / gain
```

### Quality Threshold Calculation
```
Quality Threshold = Minimum FWHM Ã— fwhm_degradation_threshold
```
